# The Writer's Crede

A writer

- Schedules daily writing time.
- Shows up and writes during the scheduled writing time.
- Stands up and walks around every 25 minutes for no more than 5 minutes (i.e., uses the Pomodoro technique).
- Limits writing to 3-5 hours per day.
- Overcomes writers block by rewriting the last paragraph or by reverse outlining a section.
- Manages their energy by doing generative writing first and supportive writing chores when tired. Does not wait to be inspired.
- Does generative writing when half-awake early in the day and editing and rewriting when fully alert later in the day.
- Masters their writing tools without letting the tools master them. 
- Writes without distractions (no YouTube videos, TV, radio, etc; playing classical music is okay).
- Tracks the time spent and words written on a project. 
- Uses a writing log for each writing project.
- Reads and writes about writing at least once a week.
- Makes writing social when its mutually beneficial. 

## Premises

- Generative writing is the most valuable activity: All other activities descend from it.
- Generative writing and editing use different parts of the brain: These activities should be done at separate times.
- Generative writing is best done when half-wake because your internal editor is not fully on.
- Editing is best done when fully awake because the internal editor will be fully activated. (Be careful; late-night editing can keep you awake later than you intend and interfere with your sleep pattern.)
- Most writing involves rewriting.
- Planning is an important (underemphasized) component of writing.
- Writing includes any activity that advances a writing project
- Many writing activities cannot be captured by the word count. Hence, the need to track the time spent during these activities to document these efforts.
- Time tracking is an important component of time management: **Writing involves a lot of time management!!**
- Due the [ultradian cycles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezT8kGzYOng), 90 minutes of writing on one project is optimal. (Thank you to my brother, Randall Mooers, for alerting me to this.)
- Writing includes any activity that advances a writing project, not just generative writing. 
  - Writing includes reading the papers that you cite. This reading activity can rejuvenate your momentum and inspire new ideas. It is best done in the evening so that your subconscious can go to work for you overnight. 
  - Writing includes mundane tasks like managing bibliographic libraries and making figures.
  - Writing includes data analysis.
