# The Writer's Crede

A writer

- Schedules daily writing time.
- Shows up and writes during the scheduled writing time.
- Stands up and walks around every 25 minutes for no more than 5 minutes (i.e., uses the Pomodoro technique).
- Limits writing to 3-5 hours per day.
- Overcomes writers block by rewriting the last paragraph or by reverse outlining a section.
- Manages their energy by doing generative writing first and supportive writing chores when tired. Does not wait to be inspired.
- Does generative writing when half-awake early in the day and editing and rewriting when fully alert later in the day.
- Masters their writing tools without letting the tools master them. 
- Writes without distractions (no YouTube videos, TV, radio, etc; playing classical music is okay).
- Tracks the time spent and words written on a project. 
- Uses a writing log for each writing project.
- Reads and writes about writing at least once a week.
- Makes writing social when its mutually beneficial. 

## Premises

- Generative writing is the most valuable activity: All other activities descend from it.
- Generative writing and editing use different parts of the brain: These activities should be done at separate times.
- Generative writing is best done when half-wake because your internal editor is not fully on.
- Editing is best done when fully awake because the internal editor will be fully activated.
- Most writing involves rewriting.
- Planning is an important (underemphasized) component of writing.
- Writing includes any activity that advances a writing project
- Many writing activities cannot be captured by the word count. Hence, the need to track the time spent during these activities to document these efforts.
- Time tracking is an important component of time management: Writing involves a lot of time management.
- Due the [ultradian cycles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezT8kGzYOng), 90 minutes of writing on one project is optimal. (Thank you to Randall Mooers for alerting me to this.)
