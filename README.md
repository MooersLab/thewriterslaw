# The Writer's Law

A writer

- Schedules daily writing time.
- Shows up and writes during the scheduled writing time.
- Stands up and walks around every 25 minutes for no more than 5 minutes.
- Limits writing to 3-5 hours per day.
- Overcomes writers block by rewriting the last paragraph or by reverse outlining a section.
- Manages their energy by doing generative writing first and supportive writing chores when tired. Does not wait to be inspired.
-  Masters their writing tools without letting the tools master them. 
- Writes without distractions (YouTube videos, TV, radio, etc; playing classical music is okay).
- Tracks the time spent and words written by project. 
- Uses a writing log for each project.
- Reads and writes about writing at least once a week.
- Makes writing social when possible.
